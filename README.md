**Nutritional Information Retrieval Application**

## **Task Description:**
NutriInfo is a Python application that provides users with detailed nutritional information for various food items. Leveraging the Edamam Food and Grocery Database API, NutriInfo seamlessly fetches and displays essential nutritional data, offering a valuable resource for those conscious of their dietary choices.

## **Implementation:**
Intuitive User Interface: NutriInfo offers a user-friendly interface for effortless interaction. Users input the name of a food item, and the application handles the rest.
Edamam API Integration: Powered by the Edamam Food and Grocery Database API, NutriInfo ensures the accuracy and reliability of the nutritional information.
In-Depth Nutritional Data: NutriInfo goes beyond basic dietary information, offering detailed insights into calories, protein content, fat content, and carbohydrates.
Robust Error Handling: The application incorporates robust error handling to ensure a smooth and reliable performance, gracefully managing HTTP and request-related issues.

## **How to Use NutriInfo:**
Input Food Name: Launch the application and input the name of the food item you want nutritional information about.
API Data Fetching: NutriInfo seamlessly connects to the Edamam API, fetching the latest and most accurate dietary data.
Informative Display: The retrieved data is elegantly presented, offering a clear and comprehensive overview of the food item's nutritional composition.

## **Security and Requirements:**
Secure API Key Handling: While the API key is embedded for simplicity in this example, it is recommended to implement more secure methods, such as using environment variables or a configuration file.
Requirements: NutriInfo requires Python 3. x and installing the requests library (pip install requests).

## **Getting Started:**
Clone Repository: Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install Dependencies: Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install necessary dependencies.
Run the Application: Execute the script using python nutriinfo.py.
Input and Explore: Follow the on-screen instructions to input a food item and explore its nutritional information.

## **Feedback and Contributions**
Your feedback and contributions to improve these Nutritional Information Retrieval Application (Web-API) are highly encouraged. Please feel free to submit issues, feature requests, or pull requests as needed.
